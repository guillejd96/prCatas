    <string name="instructions_1">To taste a beer, you must appreciate 4 fundamental variables</string>
    <string name="number_of">No. of</string>
    <string name="bottle_variable">Another variable we add in DeCatas is the <![CDATA[<b>bottle</b>]]>.</string>
    <string name="apariencia_1">To analyze the appearance of a beer you can watch:</string>
    <string name="appearance_attributes"><![CDATA[&#8226; <b>Color</b>: Yellow, caramel, copper, black...<br/><br/> &#8226; <b>Tonality</b>: Thick, translucent...<br/><br/> &#8226; <b>Foam</b>: Is it dense?, lasts?<br/><br/> &#8226; <b>Gasification</b>: Beer gas is alive or barely noticeable<br/>]]></string>
    <string name="smell_attributes"><![CDATA[&#8226; <b>Malt notes</b>: Caramel, cereal, licorize, coffee,...<br/> <br/>&#8226; <b>Beer hops notes</b>: Herbal, floral, citrus,...<br/>]]></string>
    <string name="aroma_1">" The smell depends on the type, quantity and proportion of malt and hops used in the production, as well as other elements that are added after fermentation to give other types of organoleptic qualities. So you should be aware of:"</string>
    <string name="taste_attributes"><![CDATA[&#8226; <b>Malts flavors</b>: Earthy, chocolate,...<br/><br/> &#8226; <b>Hops flavors</b>: Fruity, flowery, resinous,...<br/>]]></string>
    <string name="taste_1">For the flavor, we recommend that you enjoy a first sip that caresses the entire palate. You will notice there the first qualities of the beer, in the next one you will confirm them or discover new ones. As in the olfactory phase, when tasting beer, the flavors that you will notice depend on both the hops and the malt, or the fruits, spices, ... that are added to the beer.</string>
    <string name="body_1">You should write down the sensations that the beer has left on the palate. Not all beers, no matter how similar they are in many of their characteristics, leave the same appreciation. There are more carbonated beers, others are acidic, others bitter, others are dense, ... That is why you should appreciate:</string>
    <string name="body_attributes">"<![CDATA[&#8226; <b>Texture</b>: Light, dense,...<br/> <br/>&#8226; <b>Vivacity</b>: A lot or little gasification.<br/><br/> &#8226; <b>Predominance</b>: Sour, bitter, sweet,...<br/>]]>  "</string>
    <string name="bottle_1">Finally, to evaluate the bottle you can look at its shape, the design of the labels, its colors and shapes,...</string>

    <string name="faq">Frecuent asked questions</string>
    <string name="q_1">How do I create a new beer tasting?</string>
    <string name="q_2">How do I register beer ratings?</string>
    <string name="q_3">What is the average of a beer?</string>
    <string name="q_4">How are the results of a beer tasting calculated?</string>
    <string name="a_1">To create a beer tasting you have to go to New Beer Tasting from the user\'s home page. Next, you are asked to give the beer tasting a name and a password. This password will be used by other users to enter the tasting. The administrator of the beer tasting will be adding the names of the beers to value.</string>
    <string name="a_2">To rate a beer individually you have to go to Nueva Cerveza from the user\'s home page. In this way, you can add ratings without creating a specific beer tasting.</string>
    <string name="a_3">The average of a beer is calculated from its different evaluations of its attributes. Each attribute counts the same for the mean so an arithmetic mean is used.</string>
    <string name="a_4_1">To calculate the best average beer, the average mark of each beer is calculated for each person in the tasting. If the average mark of these previous scoes is calculated, the general average mark of the beer is obtained. The \"Best Average Beers\" table shows these averages ordered from highest to lowest.</string>
    <string name="a_4_2">To calculate the best beer according to the attribute, the average rating of all the people for that attribute is calculated. The table \"Best beers by smell / appearance / etc.\" shows these means ordered from highest to lowest</string>
    <string name="a_4_3">For the calculation of the best judge of average, the general average of the beer is subtracted for each person and each beer from the individual average valued by the person. This difference accumulates. The best judge on average is the person with the least accumulated difference.</string>
    <string name="a_4_4">To calculate the best judge by attribute, the general average of the beer for that attribute is subtracted for each person and each beer from the person\'s assessment for that attribute. This difference accumulates. The best judge according to the attribute is the person with the least accumulated difference.</string>
